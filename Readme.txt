Email Content Management

This application provides an interface to read your outlook emails, and create a summary of keywords and other other details.

To use:

1. Install python 2.7- this application runs on pyhton 2.7 only as some of the toolkits used in the project do not support other versions of Python

2. Install all the dependencies- urlparse, urllib, lxml, topia.extractor

3. Install and run a django server, on a localhost or Azure on a Windows virtual machine.

4. Run the files, and open the localhost, port no 8000 for viewing the keywords.
